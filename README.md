# Julia Set

**Mentor:** Prof Somendra Bhattacharjee

Working on efficiently programming the Julia set of fractals, exploring the implications of projecting the set (renormalisation transformation) onto a unit sphere, and studying the behaviour on the unit circle, i.e., the equator, which represent phase transitions. This is still a work in progress.
